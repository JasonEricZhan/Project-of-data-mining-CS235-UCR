# kkbox
1. K-Nearest Neighbor logistic classification model from scratch
2. This code has 2 parts, first it the preprocess of the original dataset, and second is the KNN model using Euclidean distance to compute the similarity.
3. The original dataset is too huge (7 million entries). I conducted different K values on different machine to get the accuracy.
4. K value with the maximum accuracy (which is 4 in the subset training data) is picked be the final version of this model.
5. Warning: Running this code takes 16 hours on a machine with i-7 intel core and 8GB DDR3.
6. To run the program, put all input files in a directory called "input".
